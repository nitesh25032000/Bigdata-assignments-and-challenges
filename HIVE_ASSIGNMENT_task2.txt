1. downloaded vehicle sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv
2.Storing the raw data into HDFS 
By using the filezilla move the file from local system to the cloudera then follow the steps given below
hadoop fs -put /home/cloudera/tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive_class/ -- copying the file from cloudera to HDFS
hadoop fs -ls /tmp/hive_class/ --command to check whether thefile is present in particular directory
3.# creating hive internal table sales_order_csv
create table sales_order_csv
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1"); 
4.--Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv"
load data inpath '/tmp/hive_class/' into table sales_order_csv limit 10;

5.Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"
create table sales_order_orc
(
ORDERNUMBER int,
QUANTITYORDERED int,
PRICEEACH float,
ORDERLINENUMBER int,
SALES float,
STATUS string,
QTR_ID int,
MONTH_ID int,
YEAR_ID int,
PRODUCTLINE string,
MSRP int,
PRODUCTCODE string,
PHONE string,
CITY string,
STATE string,
POSTALCODE string,
COUNTRY string,
TERRITORY string,
CONTACTLASTNAME string,
CONTACTFIRSTNAME string,
DEALSIZE string
)
stored as orc;

6.copy data from sales_order_data_csv_v1 to sales_order_data_orc

from sales_order_data_csv_v1 insert overwrite table sales_order_data_orc *;

Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
g. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold

a.SELECT YEAR_ID,SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES_PER_YEAR FROM SALES_ORDER_ORC GROUP BY YEAR_ID;
b.select MAX(QUANTITYORDERED) as max_orders_placed,PRODUCTLINE FROM SALES_ORDER_ORC GROUP BY PRODUCTLINE HAVING (MAX(QUANTITYORDERED)>90);
c.select sum(SALES) as sum_of_sales_for_each_qtr,QTR_ID from sales_order_orc GROUP BY QTR_ID;
d.select MIN(SALES) AS MIN_SALE_QTR,QTR_ID from sales_order_orc GROUP BY QTR_ID HAVING (MIN(SALES)<500);
e.select min(SALES),COUNTRY FROM SALES_ORDER_ORC GROUP BY COUNTRY HAVING(MIN(SALES)<500);
  SELECT MAX(SALES),COUNTRY FROM SALES_ORDER_ORC GROUP BY COUNTRY HAVING (MAX(SALES)>14000);
f.SELECT SUM(SALES)IN CITY,QTR_ID,CITY FROM SALES_ORDER_ORC GROUP BY QTR_ID,CITY ORDER BY QTR_ID,CITY DESC LIMIT 10;
g.SELECT MAX(QUANTITYORDERED),STATUS, MONTH_ID,YEAR_ID FROM SALES_ORDER_ORC GROUP BY STATUS,MONTH_ID,YEAR_ID HAVING STATUS='Shipped' AND MAX(QUANTITYORDERED)>95 ORDER BY MONTH_ID,YEAR_ID,STATUS;
